MediaSite
=============

> A passion of mine is to scrape known data bases for helpful details of movies, tv shows, and documentaries.
> The goal is to create a interactive web page that scrapes the media title you specify and crops out the details, such that, the web page will display details collected and an option to stream on a local area network using UPnP. The streaming service will only work if the user has the video file.

> This is using the Django web frame work.
> Later in poduction it will also use the Coherence module to do the UPnP.
