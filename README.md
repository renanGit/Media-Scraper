Media-Scraper
=============

> A passion of mine is to scrape known data bases for helpful details of movies, tv shows, and documentaries.
> The goal is to create a interactive web page that scrapes the media title you specify and crops out the details you want into a xml file.

The web page part can in fact do some dynamic programming so that we don't need to fetch previously gathered details. All we would need to do is edit the tree (ie. the xml tree).

> The purpose of the project is to get it working for a popular home theator personal computer (HTPC) application called Kodi (formally called XBMC).


> I welcome everyone that can help.
